A digital take on classic conversation decks for couples. No more lost boxes—just a phone and a moment to connect.
🛠 Tech Stack (The "No-Config" Club)

1. Next.js 14+ (App Router) – Our full-stack powerhouse.
2. Supabase – Database & Auth (because life’s too short for manual server configs).
3. Tailwind CSS – Making things look sharp without the CSS headache.
4. Gemini CLI – Our AI co-pilot (powered by GEMINI.md).

🧠 Core Principles (The Workflow)

1. Server First – Server Components are the default. We only wake up the client ('use client') for clicks, inputs, or animations.
2. No State Overkill – URL params and useState are enough. No Redux/Zustand drama for the MVP.
3. Database Driven – Questions live in Supabase, not in the codebase.
4. KISS (Keep It Simple, Sparky) – We’re shipping an MVP, not a spaceship.

🚀 Quick Start

1. npm install – The usual drill.
2. Populate .env.local with your Supabase keys.
3. npm run dev – You’re live.
